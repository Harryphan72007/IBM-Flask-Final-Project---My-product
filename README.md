Emotion Detection Web Application
Introduction

Welcome to my final project for this course! This project demonstrates my skills in application development and web deployment. I created an emotion detection web application using the Watson NLP library and deployed it with Flask. The project also includes packaging, testing, error handling, and static code analysis to ensure robustness and quality. 

Emotion Detection

Emotion detection goes beyond basic sentiment analysis by identifying nuanced emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust from text inputs. These capabilities are widely used in AI-powered chatbots, recommendation systems, and customer feedback analysis.
In this project, I leveraged Watson NLP to build an application that can analyze user-provided text and return the detected emotions in a clear and user-friendly format.

Project Tasks

To successfully complete this project, I worked through the following tasks:

Task 1: Clone the Project Repository

I started by cloning the original IBM project repository, then pushed it to my own GitHub repository so I could work with it in the Cloud IDE.

Task 2: Create an Emotion Detection Application

I used the Watson NLP library to build an emotion detection application that analyzes user text input and identifies the underlying emotions.

Task 3: Format the Output

I formatted the output to be clear, structured, and user-friendly so that users can easily interpret the detected emotions.

Task 4: Package the Application

I packaged the application with clear instructions, making it straightforward to deploy and run in different environments.

Task 5: Run Unit Tests

I created and executed unit tests to validate the applicationâ€™s functionality and confirm that the Watson NLP model integration works as expected.

Task 6: Deploy as a Web Application Using Flask

I deployed the application as a Flask web app, enabling users to access it through a web interface. This step made the project interactive and accessible.

Task 7: Incorporate Error Handling

I implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure the application gracefully manages invalid inputs, API errors, or unexpected issues.

Task 8: Run Static Code Analysis

I performed static code analysis to check for code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
